 * \brief Native MMS receive subsystem — public boundary.
 *
 * Pipeline: sms.c hands over binary SMS payloads; the WSP push envelope
 * is parsed (mms_codec.h) and MMS notifications are deduplicated by
 * (sim, transaction id) and queued. A dedicated worker thread fetches
 * m-retrieve.conf from the carrier MMSC over libcurl (proxy/interface
 * binding per SIM config), decodes it, delivers text parts to the
 * Asterisk message bus, spools attachments and best-effort acks with
 * M-NotifyResp.ind. The notification SMS is only deleted from the modem
 * once the message reaches a terminal state, so a restart re-discovers
 * pending notifications (memory-only state).
 *
 * Threading: intake runs on modem serializers; all blocking HTTP runs on
 * the MMS worker thread (never a modem serializer, never the GMainLoop
 * thread); SMS deletion is pushed back onto the owning modem's
 * serializer.
