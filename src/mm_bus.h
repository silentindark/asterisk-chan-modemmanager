 * \brief D-Bus system bus, MMManager and GMainLoop thread lifecycle.
 *
 * A private GMainContext is used instead of the global default context:
 * other modules loaded into the same Asterisk process may also use GLib,
 * and two threads cannot iterate one context.
 *
 * Signal delivery contract: proxies created before the loop thread
 * starts (the manager and its interface proxies) dispatch on the loop.
 * Proxies constructed later from other threads (create_call_sync,
 * list_*_sync results) do NOT deliver GObject signals reliably — treat
 * them as method/property handles only, and receive signals through
 * connection-level subscriptions made on the loop thread instead (see
 * mm_bus_context()).
